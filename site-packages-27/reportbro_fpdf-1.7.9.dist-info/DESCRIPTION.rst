pyfpdf: FPDF for Python
=======================

This is a fork of the PyFPDF library and fixes unicode issues. It allows usage
of non-latin-1 characters (e.g. Euro sign â‚¬) in Python 3. This is possible
by internally using a bytearray output buffer instead of a string (and should
also be more efficient). This library is used by
`reportbro-lib <https://github.com/jobsta/reportbro-lib>`_
(see also `ReportBro <https://www.reportbro.com/>`_).

PyFPDF is a library for PDF document generation under Python, ported from PHP
(see `FPDF <http://www.fpdf.org/>`_: "Free"-PDF, a well-known
PDFlib-extension replacement with many examples, scripts and
derivatives).

Compared with other PDF libraries, PyFPDF is simple, small and versatile, with
advanced capabilities, and is easy to learn, extend and maintain.
